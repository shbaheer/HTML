    For every purpose specific softwares are build for example for document writing Microsoft Words, For calculation Microsoft Excel, For sample calculation calculater and so on which is called <h1>Application software</h1>
    <h1>Database:</h1>Mostly informations in random form is not valuable so in order to get benefits from informations firt we sort informations the sort form in rows and columns is called <h1>Database</h1> 
    <h1>Browser</h1> Some time we want to see some portion of our document, or want to see some things in internet or see some informations from dataset definitely we need a softwear. Thus, the softwear which display information from different sources is called <h1>Browser</h1>
